SkiFree
=======

SkiFree is an open-source multi-platform game known for being a pack-in game for Windows
and Mac OS in the 90's. I stumbled upon a recent release of this game written in python
by Warren Sande. This is a modified version of that game which keeps track of high
scores. This game requires only python 2.7 and pygame to run. Just run skifree.py from
your shell. This game uses images and source code from
http://www.manning-source.com/books/sande/All_Files_By_Chapter/hw_ch10_code/ which
is released under the MIT License http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php. He
also included the code in his book *Hello World!* (Manning Publications, 2014).

I have contributed the data persistence web application, built using PHP and MySQL. You can

Controls
--------

You only use the left and right arrow keys to control the skier. You can switch between
five positions, adjusting the amount of turn and downhill speed. Touch the flags to earn
points (10 each), but avoid the trees or you'll take a spill!

### Happy Skiing!
